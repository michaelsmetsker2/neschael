in the decoder, replace putchar with.. 
actually delete it since you only care about the level being in the 256 byte buffer, 
bBuf being that buffer, rename it if you want, you will have to modify it somehow to make
 it not decompress everything at once


i had to modify it like that for my ggjam entry, so i made it put two $00 bytes 1/3rd and 
2/3rds into the stream, so i could decode a third, write it to vram across 2 frames, and 
repeat until its decoded, across 6 frames
ah i actually made it put 5 $00 bytes there

the code obviously had to be modified to allow for pausing and resuming compression too
in your case i would recommend stopping every, say, 64 bytes, and you could check for this
 without inserting fake 'end of stream' markers which you have to count, you could just 
 make the decode head never cross a 64-byte boundary, and inthe decoder check if 
 (decode_head & $3f) == 0
but thats assuming one screen of the level can fit in 64 or 128 bytes, if it cant,
 you could have two 256 byte buffers and alternate between them (with two duplicate 
 decoder functions to use a particular buffer)
the exact details will depend on how your levels are stored in memory
